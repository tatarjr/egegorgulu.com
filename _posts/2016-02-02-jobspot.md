# Jobspot

## Get things done!

Jobspot is a platform for outsourcing chores and errands locally, allowing job posters to save time by posting the chores they want done online and any job seeker to make some money on the side.

### Kickoff & Prototyping

I was hired as a contractor and asked to design the mobile app which would be the launch pad of the whole platform. User research and interviews were conducted by the owners prior to my arrival, so we were able to jump into action pretty quickly.

It was clear that the app needed to support a considerable amount of different use cases would require a variety of different tasks to be functional. We started by preparing a simple customer journey map and detailed user flows in order to be able to see the big picture and discover opportunities to simplify the process.

<ul class="gallery mobile list-unstyled">
{% for gal in page.gallery %}
<li class="col-sm-2 col-xs-4">
<a href="/assets/img/jobspot/wire/{{ gal.image }}" target="_blank"><img src="/assets/img/jobspot/wire/{{ gal.image }}"></a>
</li>
{% endfor %}
</ul>

Key screens were identified from these flow charts and wireframes were created for them using [Mockingbird](http://gomockingbird.com) and an interactive prototype was created with [Invision](http://invision.com).

### The Design

The user research activities conducted at kickoff allowed us to identify and simplify quite a few interaction patterns while wireframing.

The end result was able to hide a complicated processes under a simple dashboard and a smart notification system by revealing relevant information as needed.

Here are a few selected screens from the app:

<div class="viewer-cont phone row">	
	<div class="col-sm-6 col-sm-offset-1">
		<div class="iphone">
			<div class="screen"><img id="stage" src="{{ page.imgPath }}dashboard.png"></div>
			<div class="home-btn"></div>
			<div class="left-btns"></div>
			<div class="right-btn"></div>
			<div class="speaker"></div>
		</div>
	</div>
	<ul class="img-switcher col-sm-4 list-unstyled">
		<li><a data-target="{{ page.imgPath }}dashboard.png" class="active">Dashboard</a></li>
		<li><a data-target="{{ page.imgPath }}findjob.png">Find a job</a></li>
		<li><a data-target="{{ page.imgPath }}jobdetails.png">Job Details</a></li>
		<li><a data-target="{{ page.imgPath }}jobs.png">Jobs in Progress</a></li>
		<li><a data-target="{{ page.imgPath }}notifications.png">Notifications</a></li>
		<li><a data-target="{{ page.imgPath }}profile.png">Worker Profile</a></li>
	</ul>
</div>

A small icon set was also designed to be used throughout the app, denoting each category with its own visual mark.
