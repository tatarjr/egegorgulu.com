# ASOS Review

## Webshop review for Coolblue Assignment

My chosen webshop for this assignment is <a href="http://www.asos.com" target="_blank">asos.com</a>, an online fashion retailer offering over 850 brands, as well as their own brand.

### Why did you pick this site?

While ASOS is mainly a web shop, I find it very interesting because it portrays itself as a fashion brand, adding features and promoting content accordingly.

### What is good?

Their vast collection is, by far, their strongest selling point. However, under this great collection lies a dedication to fashion, and their signature product photos. For most items in their offering, you will find carefully curated outfits conveying a certain style. 

This approach not only provides a more realistic illustration of the products they sell but also provides a unique experience in which you find yourself bombarded with fashion advice.

The style feed also supports this dedication nicely with frequent posts and latest fashion advice.

Finally, free worldwide shipping shows that ASOS cares not just only about making the sale but also about how easily customers can receive their purchases. It ends the transaction with the user on a positive note with the ASOS brand and makes for a smoother experience because of the elimination of an extra step.

### What is bad?

Categorization and filtering options are their main weak spots. There are often overlapping categories with very similar functions, and their filtering options are riddled with usability issues. 

While I do appreciate the overall art direction they're going for, the design has not aged well, especially on typography and layout. 

The font sizes are often too small for modern devices, and most clickable links are lacking affordances to indicate that they're interactive. 

Layout-wise, a lack of fluid grid wastes a tonne of screen space which can be used to provide larger photos or showcase more items in a single scrolling distance.

### How could it be better?

The very first thing I'd do would be to set up analytics throughout various user flows to discover specific categories with high abandon rates and low conversion rates. Setting up analytics early in the process would also allow us to define benchmark values for future improvements.

I would then conduct various user research activities, such as card sorting and tree tests to discover the mental model of users when browsing through the selection in order to increase Discoverability and Findability of mission-critical categories and filters. I would also conduct usability studies with a task of finding a very specific item to identify the problems throughout the customer journey.

Through these findings, I'd focus on improving usability and experience throughout the site and set up sprints to address them on by one. I'd also experiment with designing and implementing a new responsive/fluid layout in line with the current art direction.

### 3 Things to Improve
>Describe 3 most important things that could be improved and why? Explain why these are the most important improvements and show them in a design.

#### 1. Checkout without an account

While ASOS provides the ability to checkout without an account, if you decide to do so, you will be redirected to the sign in/sign up screen with the sign in tab selected, which **does not contain** the link to Continue to Checkout. It is instead hidden under the signup tab.

 <img class="captioned" src="{{ page.imgPath }}checkout-cont.png"><span class="caption">Checking out without an account.</span>

While this is not overly complicated, presenting **such an obstacle at such a critical point** would likely result in abandonment from a considerable number of customers that could have been counted as conversions otherwise.

A quick solution would be showing the signup tab first instead, but a better solution would be allowing users to **continue to checkout page without any obstacles**, offering the ability to auto-fill the forms by signing in for existing customers. The ability to create an account at checkout for new customers is already provided after entering credit card details.

View <a href="{{ page.imgPath }}checkout-signin.png" target="_blank">full size</a> or <a href="{{ page.imgPath }}checkout-orig.png" target="_blank">original</a></span>

#### 2. Categories

I believe proper categorization is one of the most important aspects of a web shop. It allows people to find their needs quicker, resulting in **more streamlined journeys**, **decreased error rates** and ultimately **increased conversions**.

When starting to browse categories at ASOS, you're met with a cramped up mega-dropdown containing an inconsistent and cluttered presentation of main product categories. 

<img class="captioned" src="{{ page.imgPath }}mega-dd.png"><span class="caption">Current design on ASOS.</span>

This dropdown is particularly important because it marks the start the browsing experience and **a journey that starts with an erroneous action would have a lower chance of conversion**. 

My hypothesis is that redesigning this dropdown with more breathing room and properly grouping the product categories would improve navigation accuracy and help people find what they're looking for in a better way.

#### 3. Filtering the results

Finding a product that matches your exact needs is the cornerstone for conversion in web shops. Filters enable customers to do just that, but when poorly implemented they can cost you customers left and right. That's why being able to filter results properly is important, and I believe the experience ASOS provides can be much better in terms of usability.

One particular issue that causes a lot of problems is how ASOS chooses to display long lists of filtering values. The current method is to list them in separate scrollable containers which cause several usability issues.

<img class="captioned" src="{{ page.imgPath }}filters-anno.png"><span class="caption">Current filtering on ASOS. View <a href="{{ page.imgPath }}filters-anno.png" target="_blank">full size</a></span>

My hypothesis is that doing so would result in **shorter session durations** and **lower error rates**, possibly an increase in self-reported satisfaction and conversion rates as well.
