# Piñata

## The American Party Story

Pinata is a photo-sharing app for the American college-goer, allowing anyone to catch up on the latest parties around town and experience the campus life to the fullest.

### Kickoff & Research

We started the project with a quick meeting about what they already had and how they envisioned this product will be. 

After planning the project schedule and deliverables, I prepared persona sheets and did on-site interviews (basically, I just went to a bar and grabbed a couple of beers with some seniors) to better understand our auidence and their motivations.

We held a few more meetings and we bounced around possible ideas that would help improve the product and the user experience overall. 


### Wireframes

After the research phase, we jumped into Prototyping and Information Architecture. It was apparent from the start that the app itself would be straight-forward in terms of an interface but the real challenge lied in appealing to the target demographic and speaking their lingo if the app was to be any successful.

<ul class="gallery mobile list-unstyled">
{% for gal in page.gallery %}
<li class="col-sm-2 col-xs-4">
<a href="/assets/img/pinata/wire/{{ gal.image }}" target="_blank"><img src="/assets/img/pinata/wire/{{ gal.image }}"></a>
</li>
{% endfor %}
</ul>

After a few iterations and long discussions, we decided on a few changes and arrived at the version above. Wireframes were prepared using <a href="http://gomockingbird.com" target="_blank">Mockingbird</a> and presented as a prototype in <a href="http://invision.com">Invision</a>.


### The Design

We were finally happy with the results and ready for production. The effort we put in at the beginning of the project really paid off well here, we were able to really polish the final designs. Here are a few selected screens from the project:

<div class="viewer-cont phone row">	
	<div class="col-sm-6 col-sm-offset-2">
		<div class="iphone">
			<div class="screen"><img id="stage" src="{{ page.imgPath }}campus-feed.jpg"></div>
			<div class="home-btn"></div>
			<div class="left-btns"></div>
			<div class="right-btn"></div>
			<div class="speaker"></div>
		</div>
	</div>
	<ul class="img-switcher col-sm-4 list-unstyled">
		<li><a data-target="{{ page.imgPath }}campus-feed.jpg" class="active">Campus Feed</a></li>
		<li><a data-target="{{ page.imgPath }}highlight-reel.jpg">Highlight Reel</a></li>
		<li><a data-target="{{ page.imgPath }}photo-take.jpg">Snap a pic</a></li>
		<li><a data-target="{{ page.imgPath }}colleges.jpg">Colleges</a></li>
		<li><a data-target="{{ page.imgPath }}hof-week.jpg">Hall of Fame</a></li>
		<li><a data-target="{{ page.imgPath }}intro-2.jpg">Introduction</a></li>
		<li><a data-target="{{ page.imgPath }}campus-share.jpg">Share</a></li>
		<li><a data-target="{{ page.imgPath }}settings-notification.jpg">Settings</a></li>
	</ul>
</div>

An animation prototype was also prepared, displaying how each interaction changes the screen.
