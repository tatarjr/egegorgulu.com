# Piñata

Roman and Stephen approached me with this really cool idea about college life and how awesome it was. And what was even better was that their app allowed anyone to experience just that on their phones.

We kicked it off with a quick meeting about what they already had and how they envisioned this product will be. I did some research and we bounced around some possible ideas that would help improve this product. 

After the initial research and outlining phase, I got into information architecture and prototyping phase and presented my initial wireframes to them using mockingbird app.

After a few iterations and long discussions, we decided on which path to take and I fired up Illustrator and started working on the visual design.

We noticed a few hiccups along the way and corrected them as we progressed.
