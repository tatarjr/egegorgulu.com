# Piñata

## The American Party Story

Pinata is a mobile photo-sharing app for the American college-goer, allowing anyone to catch up on the latest parties around town and experience the campus life to the fullest.

### Kickoff & Research

I was hired as a contractor by the owners and we started the project with a quick meeting about what they already had planned and how they envisioned this product will be in the end. 

After planning the project schedule and deliverables, I prepared persona sheets and did on-site interviews to better understand our audience and their motivations.

We held a few more meetings and bounced around possible ideas that would help improve the product and the user experience overall. 


### Wireframes

After the research phase, we jumped into Prototyping and Information Architecture. It was apparent from the start that the app itself would be straight-forward in terms of an interface but the real challenge lied in appealing to the target demographic and speaking their lingo if the app was to be any successful.

<ul class="gallery mobile list-unstyled">
{% for gal in page.gallery %}
<li class="col-sm-2 col-xs-4">
<a href="/assets/img/pinata/wire/{{ gal.image }}" target="_blank"><img src="/assets/img/pinata/wire/{{ gal.image }}"></a>
</li>
{% endfor %}
</ul>

After a few iterations and long discussions, we decided on a few changes and arrived at the version above. Wireframes were prepared using <a href="http://gomockingbird.com" target="_blank">Mockingbird</a> and presented as a prototype in <a href="http://invision.com">Invision</a>.


### The Design

Having laid out the general flow of the app and wireframes for each screen, the rest of the project was a breeze. 

The effort we put in at the beginning of the project paid off well and I was able to move fast and signoff the final deliverables in a relatively shorter timeframe. 

A small usability study was conducted with 5 participants at the end of the project, allowing us to discover a few issues and fix them as we finalized the contract.

Here are a few selected screens from the app:

<div class="viewer-cont phone row">	
	<div class="col-sm-6 col-sm-offset-1">
		<div class="iphone">
			<div class="screen"><img id="stage" src="{{ page.imgPath }}campus-feed.jpg"></div>
			<div class="home-btn"></div>
			<div class="left-btns"></div>
			<div class="right-btn"></div>
			<div class="speaker"></div>
		</div>
	</div>
	<ul class="img-switcher col-sm-4 list-unstyled">
		<li><a data-target="{{ page.imgPath }}campus-feed.jpg" class="active">Campus Feed</a></li>
		<li><a data-target="{{ page.imgPath }}highlight-reel.jpg">Highlight Reel</a></li>
		<li><a data-target="{{ page.imgPath }}photo-take.jpg">Snap a pic</a></li>
		<li><a data-target="{{ page.imgPath }}colleges.jpg">Colleges</a></li>
		<li><a data-target="{{ page.imgPath }}hof-week.jpg">Hall of Fame</a></li>
		<li><a data-target="{{ page.imgPath }}intro-2.jpg">Introduction</a></li>
		<li><a data-target="{{ page.imgPath }}campus-share.jpg">Share</a></li>
		<li><a data-target="{{ page.imgPath }}settings-notification.jpg">Settings</a></li>
	</ul>
</div>

I've also coded up a quick animation prototype to display how each interaction changes the screen. This enabled us to get a better sense of how the app would behave before handing it in for development.
