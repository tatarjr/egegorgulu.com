### Kickoff & Research

We started the project with a quick meeting about what they already had and how they envisioned this product will be. 

After planning the project schedule and deliverables, I prepared persona sheets and did on-site interviews (basically, I just went to a bar and grabbed a couple of beers with some seniors) to better understand our auidence and their motivations.

We held a few more meetings and we bounced around possible ideas that would help improve the product and the user experience overall. 


### Wireframes

After the research phase, we jumped into Prototyping and Information Architecture. It was apparent from the start that the app itself would be straight-forward in terms of an interface but the real challenge lied in appealing to the target demographic and speaking their lingo if the app was to be any successful.

<ul class="gallery mobile list-unstyled">
{% for gal in page.gallery %}
<li class="col-sm-2 col-xs-4">
<a href="/assets/img/pinata/wire/{{ gal.image }}" target="_blank"><img src="/assets/img/pinata/wire/{{ gal.image }}"></a>
</li>
{% endfor %}
</ul>

After a few iterations and long discussions, we decided on a few changes and arrived at the version above. Wireframes were prepared using <a href="http://gomockingbird.com" target="_blank">Mockingbird</a> and presented as a prototype in <a href="http://invision.com">Invision</a>.
