# before-after.js

before-after.js is a project that happened because of a need on a landing page at Jotform. Adobe FormsCentral was shutting down and we built this great import tool that could just take Adobe Forms and put out JotForm forms that looked almost identicalâ€¦ and unfortunately it was too identical that it was impossible to show a comparison side-by-side. They just looked like the same thing. Thus, before-after.js was born. You can read more about it here: xxx. Let me know what you think!
