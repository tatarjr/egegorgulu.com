#Before-After.js

##A responsive image comparison slider

Before-After.js is a jQuery plugin that allows you to compare images with one another with the help of a slider inside a responsive container.

Adobe FormsCentral was shutting down and we had built this great import tool that could take an Adobe Form and put out an identical JotForm form… Unfortunately, the result was so similar that it was impossible to show a side-by-side comparison in our landing page.

Thus, before-after.js was born. 

I've also written a short article on JotForm's Medium channel about it, explaining how single decision was made along the way.
