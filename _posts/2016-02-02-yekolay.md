I was hired by yekolay.com for a redesign project, aiming to improve the marketing capabilities of the current website as well improving the overall system usability.Â 

While the previous designs worked perfectly from a task completion stand point, it was proved to be limited when trying to inform users about new deals and campaigns, more so when trying to bring recommendations and relevant content to users.
