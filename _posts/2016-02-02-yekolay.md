#Yekolay.com

## An appetizing case study

Yekolay.com is a location-based online food ordering service, with an emphasis on providing the best possible solutions for both the consumer and the restaurant.

I was hired for a redesign project, aiming to improve the marketing capabilities of the current website, such as informing users about new deals and campaigns, as well as improving the overall system usability.Â

### Wireframes

We kicked off the project by doing a heuristics analysis on the home page, identifying weak spots and areas with room for improvement. 

A couple of discussions and brainstorming sessions later, we were ready to begin sketching out solutions about what would work best and moved on from there.

<ul class="gallery list-unstyled">
{% for gal in page.gallery %}
<li class="col-sm-3">
<a href="/assets/img/yekolay/wire/{{ gal.image }}" target="_blank"><img src="/assets/img/yekolay/wire/{{ gal.image }}"></a>
</li>
{% endfor %}
</ul>

### The Design

The old design heavily promoted the search feature and our main hypothesis was to provide a clear call-to-action button right away and see if engagement increases across the board.

We were also able to vastly improve the search navigation by implementing a recommendation dropdown, immediately making every single page much more functional than before.

Tracking engagement metrics confirmed the success of these changes. Our bounce rate decreased by 5%, and traffic to our new search results page almost doubled.

Restaurant profile page was also re-designed, including an advanced rich-menu selector, based on user research data and feature requests of both of our user archetypes.
