#Yekolay.com

## An appetizing case study

Yekolay.com is a location-based online food ordering service, with an emphasis on providing the best possible solutions for both the consumer and the restaurant.

I was hired for a redesign project, aiming to improve the marketing capabilities of the current website, such as informing users about new deals and campaigns, as well as improving the overall system usability.Â 

### Wireframes

We kicked off the project by doing a heuristics analysis on the home page, identifying weak spots and areas with room for improvement. A couple of discussions and brainstorming sessions later, we were ready to begin sketching out solutions about what would work best and moved on from there.

Search results and restaurant pages were already fleshed out and nearly feature-complete, so we opted for very low-fidelity sketches for those and decided to focus on them during the design phase.

### The Design

Yekolay.com already had an established brand identity, so it was both challenging and relieving trying to keep inside those boundries while improving the look and the feel of the website.

We were able to vastly improve the search navigation by implementing a recommendation dropdown, immediately making every single page much more functional than before and the engagement metrics confirmed the success of this new navigation pattern.
