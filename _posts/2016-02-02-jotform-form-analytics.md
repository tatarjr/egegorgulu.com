# Jotform Form Analytics

The Form Analytics project was a thorn in our sides for quite a while. All our competitors had similar functionality and we were behind the competition. We set out to right that wrong, and the result was this.

Our main priority was to bring some core stats to the table such as views and conversion rates so that our users would have a general understanding of how successful their forms were performing.Â 

Once that was done, we decided to give more details for an in-depth analysis such as location, device, browser data for each of these main stats.
